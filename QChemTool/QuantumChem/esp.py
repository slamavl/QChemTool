    """ Function for restrained ESP fit of atomic center charges from 
    electrostatic potential
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    struc : Structure class
        Structure of the molecule for which ESP was generated and which will be
        used for charge fitting
    ESP_coor : numpy array of real (dimension Npoints x 3)
        Positions of points for where ESP was evaluated in ATOMIC UNITS (Bohr)
    ESP_pot : numpy array of real (dimension Npoints)
        Values of ESP in ATOMIC UNITS for molecule at points defined in ``ESP_coor``
    Q_tot : float (optional init = 0.0)
        Total charge if the molecule - constrain for fitting (Qtot = sum of all
        fitted charges). Default is neutral molecule.
    restr : float (optional init = 0.001)
        Restrain weight for hyperbolic restrains. Default value 0.001 AU 
        (ATOMIC UNITS) correspond to tight restrain criteria.
    H_fit : logical (optional init = True):
        Include hydrogens as centers for RESP fitting of atomic charges
    List : list of integer (optional init = None)
        Atomic indexes of atoms which are used as centers for RESP fitting of
        atomic charges. If not specified whole molecule is used (or molecule
        without hydrogens if ``H_fit=False``)
    Type : string (optional init = "Ground")
        If whole molecule is used for fitting charges, charges are also written
        to ``struc.esp_grnd`` or ``struc.esp_exct`` or ``struc.esp_trans`` which is 
        specified by ``Type= "Ground"``, ``Type= "Excited"`` and ``Type= "Transition"``
        respectively
    MaxInt : integer (optional init = 100)
        Maximal number of steps for SCF procedure to reach convergence
    q_tol : float (optional init = 1e-6)
        Convergence criteria for SCF procedure for difference between charges 
        from two following steps.
    NoHrestr : logical (optional init = True):
        If ``True`` no restrains for charge fitting will be used for hydrogen
        centers. If ``False`` same restrains will be used for all atoms including
        hydrogens
    constrains : list of list of integer (optional init = [])
        List of atoms with the same charges (e.g. for symmetry or other reasons).
        For example ``constrains=[[1,5,8,10],[2,6]]`` means that q[1]=q[5]=q[8]=q[10]
        and q[2]=q[6]. For using constrains it is recommended to use the whole
        structure for fitting because after exluding the hydrogens indexes might
        change. Indexing is from zero!
    Freeze : list (dimension N_frozen_atoms x 2) (optional)
        List of indexes and charges for atoms which should be frozen on constant
        charge. for example: ``Freeze=[[1,0.0],[5,0.25],...] means that charge
        of atom with index 1 will be frozen on 0.0, charge of atom with index 
        5 wil be frozen on 0.25 etc.

    procedure.**
    
    **Quadrupole moment should be calculated after transformation of coordinate
    origin into center of mass and align axes wit main axes of inetria tensor.**
